.SYNOPSIS
  Runs the tasks of a phase unattended: one fresh headless Claude Code session per task, in order.

.DESCRIPTION
  twinoak/meshmaster-agent-firmware's driver, on `main` instead of `master`, wanting Docker instead of PlatformIO. For each task of
  tasks\phase-<Phase>\README.md (its "Order and dependencies" table) from -From to -To: checks it
  has not landed yet (its report on origin/<trunk>), starts
  `claude -p "Run task NN of phase P ..." --dangerously-skip-permissions` in the repo, waits, and
  verifies the report is now on origin/<trunk>. The first task that does not land stops the run and
  writes tasks\phase-<Phase>\logs\STOPPED.md; fix or read the session log, then resume with -From NN.

  What each session does is in tasks\RUNBOOK.md. Session output goes to
  tasks\phase-<Phase>\logs\NN.log (git-ignored).

  The model: a task file may say `**Model:** <name>` in its header (e.g. claude-opus-5,
  claude-fable-5-1); otherwise -Model applies; otherwise Claude Code's own default.

  One-time setup: Docker running (Docker Desktop on Windows) - the firmware is built and its host
  tests are run inside Espressif's ESP-IDF image, pinned in tools\verify.ps1, so nothing of
  ESP-IDF needs installing on this machine. gh installed and logged in (winget install
  GitHub.cli; gh auth login) so sessions can open PRs and merge after CI - without it they merge
  locally after verification.

  .\tasks\run-all.ps1 -Phase 1                     # every task of phase 1 not yet on the trunk
  .\tasks\run-all.ps1 -Phase 1 -From 03            # resume
  .\tasks\run-all.ps1 -Phase 1 -From 04 -To 04     # one task
  .\tasks\run-all.ps1 -Phase 1 -Model claude-opus-5   # default model for tasks that name none
  .\tasks\run-pile.ps1                             # phase after phase, stopping at the first stop

  A task's branch is deleted - locally and on origin - once its report is on origin/<trunk> and
  origin/<trunk> contains the branch. The session is asked to do it first (RUNBOOK.md section 4);
  this is the second ask, for the session that was cut off before it got there.

  A session that dies on a usage or rate limit (Claude Code prints "usage limit" / "rate limit" and
  ends without landing the task) is not a stop: the driver waits -RetryWaitMinutes and starts the
  same task again, up to -MaxRetries times. The new session finds the task's branch and continues
  it (RUNBOOK.md section 1), so nothing done before the limit is lost. A deliberate stop (the
  session wrote STOPPED-NN.md) is never retried.

  The script ends with exit code 0 when every task of the range landed and 1 when it stopped, so
  that run-pile.ps1 can chain phases.
